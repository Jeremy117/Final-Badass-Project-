//This file will accomplish a few things.
//1. It will define the actions associated with the Roster
//2. It will contain the markup for the roster itself
//3. It will have the appropriate life-cycle methods for the roster

//Actions Associated with the Roster
//1. Roster Loaded
//2. Add Player

//Styling for the Roster
//1. We will need an infinite scrolling page that allows us to link to player profiles.
//2. We need a search box that pops up which allows us to search and add players in the database to the roster

//Lifecycle Methods
//1. We need a lifecycle method which will pull players for the associated team when the component mounts
